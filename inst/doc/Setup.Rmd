## 1. Miniconda + Modules {#section_1}

*transforEmotion* uses the *reticulate* package to automatically install a standalone miniconda version on your computer. The first time you run the `transformer_scores` function miniconda will begin installing. By having a standalone miniconda installed through *transforEmotion*, you should not have any conflicts between miniconda and existing Python installations. The miniconda installation takes a few minutes to complete. At some points it might seem like the installer is stuck but give it a few moments and the installer should complete its process in no time.

After installing miniconda, there are several Python modules that need to be installed. Once again, *transforEmotion* will download these modules to your miniconda installation to avoid conflicts with previous Python installations. The modules should install in a few minutes.

## 2. huggingface Transformers {#section_2}

You can use any number of \href{https://huggingface.co}{huggingface} text classification transformers. *transforEmotion* currently implements the zero-shot classification models only. Future updates to the package may include opportunities to train and fine-tune these models but for now there are several options that work well for most classification tasks straight out-of-the-box. You can view different transformers that can be used in *transforEmotion* here: https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=zero-shot-classification.

## 3. Using `transformer_scores` {#section_3}

As mentioned in section [1](#section_1), the first time you run `transformer_scores` miniconda and the necessary modules will be installed. Next, \href{https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/nli-distilroberta-base}{Cross-Encoder's DistilRoBERTa} transformer model will be downloaded. So, the easiest way to get started is by using an example

```{r transformers_scores, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, comment = NA, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Load data
data(neo_ipip_extraversion)

# Example text
text <- neo_ipip_extraversion$friendliness[1:5] # positively worded items only

# Run transformer function
transformer_scores(
    text = text,
    classes = c(
      "friendly", "gregarious", "assertive",
      "active", "excitement", "cheerful"
    )
)
```

The downloads will take some time. Once you have miniconda and the modules installed, you won't have to install them again. The same goes for the transformer models: You will only need to download them once. Assuming all goes well with the above code, you should see output that looks like this

```{r transformers_scores_output, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, comment = NA, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
$`make friends easily`
  friendly gregarious  assertive     active excitement   cheerful 
     0.579      0.075      0.070      0.071      0.050      0.155 

$`warm up quickly to others`
  friendly gregarious  assertive     active excitement   cheerful 
     0.151      0.063      0.232      0.242      0.152      0.160 

$`feel comfortable around people`
  friendly gregarious  assertive     active excitement   cheerful 
     0.726      0.044      0.053      0.042      0.020      0.115 

$`act comfortably around people`
  friendly gregarious  assertive     active excitement   cheerful 
     0.524      0.062      0.109      0.183      0.019      0.103 

$`cheer people up`
  friendly gregarious  assertive     active excitement   cheerful 
     0.071      0.131      0.156      0.190      0.362      0.089
```

If you want to run `transformer_scores` over additional text, then you can simply enter that text into the `text` argument of the function. The transformer models that you've used during your R session will remain in R's environment until you exit R or remove them from your environment.

That's it! You've successfully obtained sentiment analysis scores from \href{https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/nli-distilroberta-base}{Cross-Encoder's DistilRoBERTa} transformer model. Now, go forth and quantify the qualitative!
